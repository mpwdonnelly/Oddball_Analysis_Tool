                <br>
                <p>The first step of data processing is to extract the epochs for all the trials
                    that go with each condition: 36 of the target stimulus ("oddball") and 144 of the standard. <br>
                    Then we
                    overlay them so that each timepoint relative to the stimulus onset time of zero (0), we can see that
                    they are very noisy, with no two being identical</p>

            <div id="averagedGraph">
                <svg id="graph" width="800" height="700"></svg>
                <br>
                <p>Now we add up the voltages measured at each timepoint in each of the trials
                    that
                    goes with each condition, and take their average value, and then plot the averaged values. <br> This
                    results
                    in the first-pass averaged function, and there is one for each condition. These two functions should
                    give us a rough idea of how good our results look <br> (compared to what you see in papers on this
                    ERP, the
                    P300)</p>

            <div id="baselineGraph">
                <svg id="graph2" width="800" height="700"></svg>
                <br>
                <p class="spanBaselineCorrected">Next we take the averaged functions, and determine how far off of
                    the
                    zero-voltage line each is in the time window PRIOR TO the onset of the stimulus (time point zero).
                    <br> We
                    calculate the average deviation from zero for each of the two conditions, and then substract that
                    value
                    from all the values of the function. <br> This makes it so the two functions (oddball and standard)
                    are
                    registered (overlay each other) in the baseline, and ensures that any differences we see after the
                    stimulus onset <br> are indicative of differences in the way the brain processes the two
                    stimuli</p>

            <div id="movingAverageGraph">
                <svg id="graph3" width="800" height="700"></svg>
                <br>
                <p>Finally we make one more pass over the functions, in order to smooth them a
                    little bit more. In this averaging pass, we compare the values of all the time points around each
                    individual time point <br> and computer their average, and take this as the new value of the that
                    time
                    point. This is called moving window averaging, and is a standard method of post-processing noisy
                    time
                    series data like we have here. <br> However, the choice of how wide of a window to average is
                    important. Here
                    we have selected a 20 msec window, where the time point is averaged with the two that precede it and
                    the
                    two that follow it.</p>
