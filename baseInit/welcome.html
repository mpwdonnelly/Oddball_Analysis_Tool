<h1>Event-Related Potential (ERP) Calculator Tool</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Users can run this tool to analyse EEG data collected after they have
    performed
    the Oddball Experiment. In this experiment, a subject has been prepped to
    collect
    scalp voltages from one location (on the midline, just behind the top of the
    head)
    with ground and reference (the black and white wires, respectively) attached
    to the mastoids (located just behind each ear).
</p>
<h2>How the Entire Process Works</h2>
<p>First, run the experiment using the correct experiment program on the
    stimulus
    computer. This is the one displaying Xs and Os while the subject watches.
    While
    the subject views these images, the other computer (The Acquisition
    Computer) is
    connected to the amplifier (Blue Box) and should show a scrolling jaggedy
    line
    representing the voltages measured moment-by-moment on the subject's
    scalp.</p>
<p>Once the process is completed, the experimenter should wait until the
    acquisition
    computer stops recording, then in the interface window, pull down the File
    menu and
    select "Save As..." and choose to save the file as a comma-delimited text
    file (.csv).</p>
<p>Then, the experimenter should find the file on the computer and copy it to a
    thumb
    drive and save it using a name that is easy to remember. Information about
    what is
    in the data file should be right in the name (example:
    "JohnDoeOddballEEGdata"</p>
<p>Finally, subjects should bring that file to a computer running this app, and
    make it so that the file can be found and opened.</p>
<h2>When you are ready to analyze the data</h2>
<ol>

    <li>In the next window, click the button "Open Data File"</li>
    <li>Navigate to the file and click to open it.</li>
    <li>Verify that you have selected the correct file.</li>
    <li>Click "See the Results" button.</li>
